# Pirates Hide'N Seek

Pirates Hide'N Seek is a C++ game I made in my first semester as a student of the Computer Science Faculty in Iasi. The game is inspired by a puzzle board game for children. The purpose of the game is for you to cover all extra symbols with pieces and only have a specific level's symbols left on the board.
